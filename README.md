# Page Ranking
Using Power Iteration method to do page ranking

Use a random teleporting probability of 0.2 and run your algorithm using the google web graph dataset.
Dataset is available hele : http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Google.txt.gz

This dataset has a subset of the web graph. Each line in the file has two numbers separated by a space. This represents a directed edge in the graph. For example, "0 824020" is an edge from node 0 to node 824020. Below are the first 10 lines in the file:
